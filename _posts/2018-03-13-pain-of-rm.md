To this end I use trash-cli package and the following alias in my ~/.bashrc

`alias rm=trash`
The files you remove will be moved to trash, and you can see them in nautilus trashcan.

You can always access the real rm by using one of the following method:

command rm something
‘rm’ something
\\rm something
There are also commands to access the trashcan from terminal, trash-list, restore-trash (or trash-restore), trash-empty installable from package trash-cli (then see their man pages).
